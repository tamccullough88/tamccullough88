# 👋 Hey!

## About Me
- 👨‍🎓 I recently graduated from a Software Development boot camp, but that does not mean I am done learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my knowledge in Python backend frameworks, Javascript/React frontend, Theme.liquid, and soon C++
- 🍖 I want to make a simple can controller for my smoker to help maintain the heat with an Arduino, any suggestions?
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-andrew-mccullough/ | Email - TAMcCullough88@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: 🎸I have been a musician most of my life. I took piano lessons at a young age, taught myself bass and guitar, and have been in multiple bands.
